        <h1 id="main-heading">Decision Support System for Water Governance</h1>
        <p id="introduction">
            This project proposal addresses the critical need for a comprehensive Decision Support System (DSS) to
            manage water resources effectively.
            By integrating sophisticated models and simulations, the system will support sustainable water governance,
            ultimately contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
        </p>

        <h2 id="objectives-heading" style="text-align: left;">Introduction: Water Governance Challenges</h2>
        <p id="section-1-content">
            Water governance is a complex, multi-dimensional challenge exacerbated by climate change, urban expansion,
            and socio-economic dynamics.
            The aim of this DSS is to provide holistic solutions to water management by combining hydrological,
            socio-economic, and ecological factors through an integrated modeling framework.
        </p>

        <h2 id="objectives-heading" style="text-align: left;">Project Objectives</h2>
        <div class="objectives">
            <ul>
                <li>Development of a Data Management Framework to handle large-scale, multi-source water data.</li>
                <li>Design of an Integrated Hydro-Computational Modeling Framework to simulate water behaviors.</li>
                <li>Creation of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for simplified decision-making and visual data
                    representation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h2 id="objectives-heading" style="text-align: left;">Potential Applications of the DSS</h2>
        <div class="applications">
            <ul id="applications-list">
                <!-- List items will be populated by JavaScript -->
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="objectives-heading" style="text-align: left;">Key Collaborations and Supporting Missions</h2>
        <p id="collaborations">
            This DSS will work in alignment with national water projects like the <strong>Jal Jeevan Mission</strong>,
            <strong>Atal Bhujal Yojana</strong>, <strong>National Hydrological Project</strong>, and <strong>National
                Groundwater Management Improvement Program-2</strong>, to name a few. By integrating these missions'
            goals into our system, we aim to enhance India's water resource management capabilities.
        </p>

        <h2 id="objectives-heading" style="text-align: left;">Technological Framework</h2>
        <p id="tech-content">
            The DSS will utilize advanced data from sources such as the Central Water Commission (CWC), India
            Meteorological Department (IMD), and satellite imagery from NASA's MODIS and Sentinel satellites.
            By combining these data sources and applying system thinking methodologies, the DSS will facilitate
            informed, effective decision-making at multiple levels of water governance.
        </p>

        <h2 id="objectives-heading" style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p id="conclusion">
            This DSS will serve as a critical tool for water resource management, supporting policymakers, stakeholders,
            and local authorities in managing water systems sustainably and effectively, contributing to the long-term
            achievement of the SDGs.
